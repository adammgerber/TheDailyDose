# TheDailyDose
Python NLP script that automatically generates anki deck from a daily news article based on input language

The theory behind this project is that in order to accelerate language learning, not only should we learn relevant vocabulary, but we should connect that vocabulary with a story or some sort of emotion, conveying to our brain that these new words are important to remember.
News these days seem to be more and more sensationalized, and as a result provide us an efficient way of adding vocabulary
